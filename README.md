There are 2 ways to use this app:

# 1: Easy way (less secure)
Use our @athomhomey_bot which is a shared bot. In theory we might be able to read the messages you send to the bot and back. We will not do that, but it is technically possible.

# 2: Slightly harder way (fully secure)
Set up your own Telegram bot. This is fully secure and private, since you are the only one who can access the message archive.

Before you can use this app, you first have to follow the steps on the Settings page in Homey.
